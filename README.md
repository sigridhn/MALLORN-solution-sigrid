# MALLORN-solution-sigrid
An overview of my third place solution for the MALLORN data challenge. A write-up will be available on Kaggle: (link to come) <br>

The different directories contain the following:

- input-data: CSV files containing all features extracted from the training/test sets
- notebooks: jupyter notebooks detailing the final classifier (MALLORN_2dgp.ipynb) and feature extraction (the rest)
- figures: feature importance plots
